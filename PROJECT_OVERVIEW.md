- **Market trends** and investment opportunities
- **Regional analysis** covering Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Nakuru, and more

### 3. API Endpoints (`app/main.py`)
- `POST /chat` - Main conversational interface
- `POST /property/search` - Structured property search
- `GET /market/analysis/{location}` - Location-specific analysis
- `GET /properties/price-estimate` - Property valuation
- `GET /health` - System health check
- `GET /knowledge/status` - Knowledge base statistics

### 4. Docker Setup
- **Production-ready** containerization
- **Multi-stage builds** for optimization
- **Health checks** and monitoring
- **Nginx reverse proxy** with SSL support
- **Environment variable** configuration
